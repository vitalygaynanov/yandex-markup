          <blockquote class="first-paragraph">
            Al&shy;bus Dumble&shy;dore was nev&shy;er proud or con&shy;ceited,
            he knew how to find something valu&shy;able in any per&shy;son,
            no mat&shy;ter how in&shy;sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;ant or pathet&shy;ic
            he may seem, and I think that the losses he ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;enced
            in his early years gave him a great hu&shy;man&shy;ity and a
            ca&shy;pa&shy;city for com&shy;pas&shy;sion. I won't even try to
            de&shy;scribe how much I will miss his friend&shy;ship, but my loss
            is noth&shy;ing com&shy;pared to that suffered by the
            wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing com&shy;munity. There is no doubt that D
            umble&shy;dore was the bright&shy;est and most be&shy;loved of all
            the dir&shy;ect&shy;ors of Hog&shy;warts.

                go&shy;ing so far as to call Pot&shy;ter “the Chosen One,”
                be&shy;liev&shy;ing that the proph&shy;ecy names him as the only
